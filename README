hi all,

this is a finance tool for profit analysis,
you can define your entry point in it and you will get a sample report for "make or lost profits" based on our rules.

what's the rules?

1. entry points (buy)
if you want to buy a ticket at 2010/10/10, 
we will get the next bar open price at 2010/10/11 to our entry point,

why? 
because we are so confused the price at 2010/10/10, what's price we should get. high, low, open, close....
so we used the "next bar entry rule" to avoid it.

2. recalls (re-buy, re-sell) in hold position
if the current price was fit our constrain, we would sell or buy it in close price.

re-buy 
2-1 
what's "re-buy", "re-sell"?
if the current profits is outoff our balance range, 
we would try to re-buy/re-sell the tickets again, that can rebalance our profits

3. leave points (sell)
if the current profits is outoff our max make/lost range,
we woudld leave the market at close price.


results
you can open "rep.csv" by excel/open-offic

or you can change our system define in "data.pl"

default valus:
	"LEAVE_PROFIT_LOST" => '10.0',          #出場停損 10%
	"LEAVE_PROFIT_MAKE" => '7.0',           #出場獲利 7%
	"KEEP_PROFIT_LOST"  => '5.0',           #持有時確保 損失 達 -5%,如超過則回補
        "KEEP_PROFIT_MAKE"  => '3.0',           #持有時確保 獲利 達  3%,如操過則加碼
